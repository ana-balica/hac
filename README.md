Humanizing among coders is a keynote presented at PyCon CZ 2016. 
This is the [original video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npyB5Oz-v-I).

**If you like this talk and wish to present it at a meetup/conference/hackday, go ahead and do it!** 
Grab a version of the slides, adjust bits you think appropriate and present it in front of an audience.

### Original pitch

What makes a good developer? Certainly technical expertise, insightfulness, creativity, thoughtfulness. 
What about daily social interactions with other developers inside the company and community? Those are never easy. 
Even though we all try to be nice to each other, sometimes unintentionally we can be a bit off. 
I'd like to share with you some stories that helped me rationalize some of my own communication
and human interaction mistakes and how I'm trying to correct them.

### Usage guide

1. Use your best judgement on keeping the essence of the talk the same.
2. Be kind. Don't include material that could express any sort of harrasment towards others. Sexual language and imagery are not appropriate.
3. Reference the original author (me).
4. Add yourself as a speaker and a link to your slides to this repo, if you want to :)

*I'm open for suggestions on how to improve this sharing scheme.* 
This is not a piece of software, so I'm reluctant on adding an open source licence to it.
